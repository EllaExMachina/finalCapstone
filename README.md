Capstone Project:

Project Name: Task Manager 
In this project I created a program for a small business that can help it to manage tasks assigned to each member of the team. 
It allows the admin to view data and register new users. The other users of the program can view tasks assigned to them. All assigned tasks are saved in a separate text file. 

Installation: install python file into local interpreter. Make sure a separate text file created into the folder to read and write the tasks. 

Usage: Use to register new users for your business, assign or read tasks given.
